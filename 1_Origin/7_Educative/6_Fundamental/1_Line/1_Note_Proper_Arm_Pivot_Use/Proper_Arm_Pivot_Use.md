###### **_Theory_**
The use of your wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints when drawing is important, both for smoother confidant lines, but also for your health, especially if you primarily use your wrist to draw. Your arm joints in the wrist, elbow and shoulder move in an arc, with wrist having the smallest arc and the shoulder the widest. As such for longer and larger lines, the shoulder is going to be the most accurate and straight. Use your wrist, elbow, and shoulder in a mix whenever you are drawing.
