###### **_Theory_**
![[Screenshot 2022-07-23 234920.jpg]]
1. Achieve as smooth straight line possible
2. Pass two or more points with as little fraying at the ends as possible
3. Have as little under/overshooting as possible
4. Utilize proper arm pivots and ghosting skill as much as possible

###### **_Classification_**
**Passive Skill** : Straight lines are integral to drawing or painting
**A Tier**: A vital skill to have a grasp on for all marks with straight geometry

###### **_Practice Guideline_**
Exercise 1: Super Imposed Lines
The most basic exercise you draw through two or more points in a straight line utilizing the Theory mentioned above.

Exercise 2: Stroke Density Dexterity practice
a more advanced exercise the first is too attempt to have consistent straight lines with even spacing, the next is to have consistent density lines (with consistent angles) bounded in a box, and lastly consistent lines bounded by various shapes. This exercise is to practice multiple straight line dexterity, keeping multiple lines consistent.

Exercise 3: Angled Lines Dexterity
Another advanced exercise, have a point and attempt to have straight lines pass through the point in various different angles, then attempt to do the same but bounded by a circular shape, and lastly with various shapes. The purpose of this exercise is too increase your dexterity with creating angled lines and to give intuite sense on creating lines on any angle.
