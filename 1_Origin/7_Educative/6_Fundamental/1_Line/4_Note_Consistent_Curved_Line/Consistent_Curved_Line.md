###### **_Theory_**
1. Achieve as smooth curved line possible
2. Pass two or more points with as little fraying at the ends as possible
3. Have as little under/overshooting as possible
4. Utilize proper arm pivots and ghosting skill as much as possible

###### **_Classification_**
**Passive Skill** : curved lines are integral to drawing or painting
**A+ Tier**: A vital skill to have a grasp on for all marks (arguably more important then straight lines as nature is made much more often of curves rather then straight lines)

###### **_Practice Guideline_**
Exercise 1: Super Imposed Lines
The most basic exercise you draw through two or more points in a curved line utilizing the Theory mentioned above.

Exercise 2: Stroke Density Dexterity practice
a more advanced exercise the first is too attempt to have consistent curved lines with even spacing, the next is to have consistent density lines (with consistent angles) bounded in a box, and lastly consistent lines bounded by various shapes. This exercise is to practice multiple straight line dexterity, keeping multiple lines consistent.

Exercise 3: achieving curves bounded by lines
Another advanced exercise, have straight lines angled at random degrees from eachother, then attempt to draw curves that are bounded within the lines (can attempt various curvatures.)
