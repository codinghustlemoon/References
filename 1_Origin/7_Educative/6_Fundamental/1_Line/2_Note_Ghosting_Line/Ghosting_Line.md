###### **_Theory_**
A mindset to think before you put down lines. Always keep the line in your mind and follow the motion without actually putting down the lines. 

Identify the specific nature of a line:
1. straight or curved
2. short or long
3. use wrist, elbow, or shoulder pivots

Identify the function of the line, what does it contribute?
Rough sketching, construction lines, clean finished linework, texture, hatching value, eyelashes for an eye etc.

###### **_Classification_**
**Passive Skill** : As it is a mental tool used for enhancing linework, allowing for more accurate lines
**B Tier**: While very helpful in allowing for more stable linework, with sufficient skill with lines, ghosting lines can be less used, it can be a very helpful tool for getting better for beginners however.

###### **_Practice Guideline_**
Whenever you are connecting two or more points (line) actively remember to go through ghosting before actually applying the line untill it becomes intuitive. 

Some potential landmarks to keep in mind is to focus on a steady trajectory, starting at an exact point and ending at an exact point with as little over/undershooting as possible.
